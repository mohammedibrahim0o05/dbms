### Name : Mohammed ibrahim mn 
### Reg No : 212223100034

##  Objective
To understand and apply *Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling* concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

##  Purpose
This workshop provides hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent *database structure*, including:
- Entities
- Relationships
- Attributes
- Constraints  

---

##  Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

###  Business Context
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its *members, trainers, and fitness programs*.

###  Requirements
- Members register with *name, membership type, and start date*.  
- Each member can join *multiple programs* (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers are *assigned to programs*; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may *book personal training sessions* with trainers.  
- *Attendance* recorded for each session.  
- *Payments* tracked for memberships and sessions.

### Entities and Attributes
| Entity   | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Member   | MemberID (PK), Name, MembershipType, StartDate | Registers for programs |
| Program  | ProgramID (PK), Name, Type | Yoga, Zumba, etc. |
| Trainer  | TrainerID (PK), Name, Specialization | Assigned to programs |
| Session  | SessionID (PK), Date, Time, MemberID (FK), TrainerID (FK) | Personal training |
| Payment  | PaymentID (PK), Amount, Date, MemberID (FK), Type | Membership/session |

###  Relationships and Constraints
| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Member–Program | M:N | Total | A member can join many programs |
| Program–Trainer | M:N | Partial | Trainers assigned to programs |
| Member–Trainer (Personal Session) | M:N | Partial | Booked sessions |
| Session–Attendance | 1:N | Total | Tracks presence |
| Member–Payment | 1:N | Total | Payments for membership & sessions |

###  Assumptions
- Each session involves *one member and one trainer*.  
- Membership type determines validity period (not modeled in ER).  
- Payments linked either to membership or personal training.

##  Scenario B: City Library Event & Book Lending System

###  Business Context
The Central Library wants to manage *book lending and cultural events*.

###  Requirements
- Members borrow books, with *loan and return dates tracked*.  
- Each book has *title, author, and category*.  
- Library organizes *events*; members can register.  
- Each event has *one or more speakers/authors*.  
- *Rooms* are booked for events and study.  
- *Overdue fines* apply for late returns.

###  Entities and Attributes
| Entity   | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Member   | MemberID (PK), Name, Contact | Registers & borrows books |
| Book     | BookID (PK), Title, Author, Category | Lending unit |
| Loan     | LoanID (PK), LoanDate, ReturnDate, MemberID (FK), BookID (FK) | Tracks borrow |
| Event    | EventID (PK), Name, Date | Library event |
| Speaker  | SpeakerID (PK), Name, Expertise | Linked to events |
| Room     | RoomID (PK), RoomNo, Capacity | Used for events/study |
| Fine     | FineID (PK), Amount, LoanID (FK) | Late returns |

###  Relationships and Constraints
| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Member–Loan | 1:N | Total | Each loan belongs to a member |
| Book–Loan | 1:N | Total | Each loan involves one book |
| Event–Member | M:N | Partial | Members register for events |
| Event–Speaker | M:N | Total | Multiple speakers per event |
| Event–Room | 1:1 | Total | Each event held in a room |
| Loan–Fine | 1:1 | Partial | Fine only if overdue |

###  Assumptions
- A book can only be borrowed by *one member at a time*.  
- Event rooms cannot host *multiple events simultaneously*.  
- Fines calculated externally (not within ER).
